# rs3nxt-ghidra-scripts-9.1.x-support
Ghidra scripts to help reverse-engineer RS3's NXT client. Currently one huge messy file that performs a few simple operations such as creating/setting up a few data structures, and finding some methods in the binary.

:warning: This has only been tested on win64 binaries. MacOS and Linux binaries will not work due to different calling conventions.

:warning: This script is for Ghidra version 9.1.x. Move to the 9.2.x branch if your Ghidra is higher than 9.1.x
